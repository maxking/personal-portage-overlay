# This file extends the base packages file for the default profile that all
# architectures will enjoy.  Please note that default is what most architectures
# will have.  Some will have an selinux profile (see ${PORTDIR}/profiles/selinux).
# The idea is to only create a new family of profiles when absolutely necessary.
